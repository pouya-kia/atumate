### The required libraries include:

- **numpy**
- **pandas**
- **matplotlib**
- **seaborn**
- **scikit-learn**
- **scipy**
- **statsmodels**
- **fuzzy-c-means**
- **scikit-learn-extra**

### Additional Packages

Ensure you have access to the following database engines for SQL data loading:

- **SQLite**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **MySQL**
- **Oracle**

### File Descriptions

1. main.py: The entry point of the project, orchestrating the overall workflow and managing transitions between stages.

2. data_loader.py: Contains functions for detecting the data source type (CSV, Excel, SQL) and loading data into a pandas DataFrame.

3. data_cleaning.py: Functions for handling missing data, filling missing values, and formatting date columns.

4. data_preprocessor_1.py: Functions to display column information, drop columns, and change column data types.

5. data_preprocessor_2.py: Handles advanced data transformations, including binning, outlier detection, and correlation analysis. This file also provides visualization functions for exploring distributions.

6. model_and_evaluation.py: Contains functions for supervised and unsupervised model selection, training, and evaluation. Includes support for various metrics and model types.

7. manage_flow.py: Manages user choices at each stage of the workflow, allowing them to go back to previous steps if needed.

8. requirements.txt: Lists the required libraries for easy installation.

### Usage

1. Run the main script:

in the bash (Copy code)
python main.py

2. Follow the prompts to load a data source and proceed through each stage of the workflow:

- **Data Loading**: Choose a data source and load it into the environment.
- **Data Preprocessing**: View and clean the data, including handling missing values, changing column types, and formatting dates.
- **Feature Engineering**: Apply transformations like binning, encoding, and outlier handling.
- **Modeling and Evaluation**: Select and train machine learning models, evaluate their performance, and view summary results.

3. Optional steps allow users to:

- Return to previous stages if adjustments are needed.
- Explore alternative models and evaluation metrics.

### Example Workflow

1. Load a CSV file by specifying the file path.
2. Review data information and choose to drop columns if necessary.
3. Specify columns with missing values and choose a fill method (forward fill, backward fill, etc.).
4. Transform numeric columns using scaling methods.
5. Choose a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest for supervised tasks) and evaluate performance.
